**PrAnaViz** is a web-browser based R/Shiny tool developed by the [Environmental Chemistry and Public Health Group](https://people.bath.ac.uk/bkh20/) at the University of Bath.

**PrAnaViz** facilitates users to visualize, explore and report different spatio-temporal and long-term prescription trends of different Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs) in prescription medications for human use in the UK for wider use. This tool helps to understand the general practice level and postcode level variation of an API. This tool uses the processed dataset generated by the R package, **PrAna** for the period 2015 to 2018.

**PrAna** aims to aggregate and normalize England's national level prescription data, for all groups of drugs. The name is an acronym for **Pr**escription **Ana**lysis.

**Demo App** available in the menu is a prototype tool for demonstration purpose and has the dataset for the years 2015 to 2018 limited to Bath and North East Somerset Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) region
