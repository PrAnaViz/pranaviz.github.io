## *PrAnaViz*

### Introduction

The aim of this tool is to visualize and analyze the prescription data to calculate total prescribed quantity of different APIs and to explore spatiotemporal trends of different APIs at Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) regions with resolution to individual postcode. ***Note:*** The demo version of the tool hosted in the [link](http://51.141.234.162/shiny/pranaviz/ "PrAnaViz Demo") present only **Bath and North East Somerset CCG** dataset.

We have created, **PrAnaViz**, in a familiar browser-based dashboard layout that most users are familiar with from typical websites and online tools. The basis functionality of *PrAnaViz* is filtering datasets and producing graphs according to selection criteria defined by the user.

*PrAnaViz* grouped into two panels (1) Targeted API, (2) Non-targeted API, that each consist of two to three output boxes displaying the results. Users can navigate between different panels through clicking the respective option in the sidebar. And the user-defined selection can be downloaded in a *.pdf* or *.eps* and data as *.csv* format for further analysis.

### Targeted Panel

In this panel, user can input a list of APIs in *.csv* format as in the **Figure:4.1**, and find out the total prescription quantity of each API in the selected year, at the selected CCG region, and 5 different selection criteria can be found in this panel as in **Table 1**.

| Criteria | Functionality |
| --- | ----------- |
| Upload targets           | Upload target list, i.e., APIs in `.csv` format|
| Select Prescription Year | Select the prescription year of interest       |
| Select Region            | Select the CCG region of interest      |
| Select Graph Type        | Define the output as total prescription for the year or month wise prescription |
| Setting Type             | Select the General Practice setting type |

Table 1. Selection criteria in Targeted Panel

All output is based on the selection criteria defined by the user in the panel. Each new selection and any change needs to be confirmed by clicking the **Generate Graph** button. Results are shown in a bar chart or a line chart based on the user selection criteria (**Select Graph Type**) as in the **Figure:4.2.**

The bottom portion of this panel visualize the total quantity of a selected API prescribed by month, GP, Chemical form, and Medicinal form for a CCG region in a selected year, these line plots will be generated by clicking an API in the **Bar Chart**.

User can download data as *.csv* file and publication ready image *.eps* and *.pdf* files.

### Non-targeted Panel

Total prescription quantity of an individual API at different postcode per month at a CCG region, can be rendered in this panel.

All output is based on the selection criteria defined by the user in the panel (**Table 2**). Each new selection and any change needs to be confirmed by clicking the **Generate Graph** button. The calculated total prescription quantity of an individual API at postcode level helps to find the hotspots as in the **Figure: 4.3.**


| Criteria                      | Functionality  |
| --- | ----------- |
| Select BNF Chemical substance | Select API of interest                                                          |
| Select Region                 | Select the CCG region of interest                                               |
| Select Prescription Year      | Select the prescription year of interest                                        |
| Select Month                  | Define the output as total prescription for the year or month wise prescription |
