## _PrAnaViz_

### Introduction

The aim of this tool is to visualise and analyse the prescription data to calculate total prescribed quantity of different APIs and to explore spatiotemporal trends of different APIs for wider use.

We have created, __PrAnaViz__, in a familiar dashboard layout with two tabs: (1) Targeted API, (2) Non-targeted API, to visualize total quantity of different APIs at CCG region with resolution to individual postcode.

### Targeted Approach

In this tab, user can input a list of APIs, and find out the total prescription quantity of each API in the selected year, at the selected CCG region, as in the Figure: 4.1.

This tab also visualise the total quantity of APIs prescribed by month, GP, Chemical form, and Medicinal form for a CCG region in a selected year.

| Option	| Remarks |
|---|----------------|
| 1 | Select Targeted or Non-Targeted Approach |
| 2	| Select Year, Region and Setting Type |
| 3	| Upload targets i.e., APIs in _.csv_ format |
| 4	| Select monthwise or yearwise plots |
| 5 |	Plot generated based on user selection |
| 6 |	Download buttons to download the generated plot as _.pdf_ or _.eps_ and data as _.csv_ format |
| 7 |	More insights on a selected API, visualise total prescribed quantity of the API per month, GP practice, postcode and medicinal form (click on a particular API on the barplot to generate these plots) |
| 8 |	Download buttons to download the generated plot as _.pdf_ or _.eps_ and data as _.csv_ format |

### Non-targeted Approach

Total prescription quantity of an individual API at different postcode per month at a CCG region, can be rendered in this tab, as in the Figure: 4.2.
The calculated total prescription quantity of an individual API at postcode level helps to find the hotspots.
User can download data as _.csv_ file and publication ready image _.eps_ and _.pdf_ files.
